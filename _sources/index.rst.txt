   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to abcd's documentation!
================================

Goal:

- easy installation (docker support)
- easy to use (python classes for notebooks and command line for scripts)
- secure (api instead of direct db access, https)
- flexible (server-client application, flask blueprints)
- scalable database (nosql like mongodb)

Quick start/Basic usage
-----------------------
Installation:

``python setup.py install``

usage:

::

    with ABCD(url='http://localhost:5000/api') as db:
        results = db.search('formula=Fe3O1;elements=[Fe,*];n_atoms=10,pbc;metadata.collection=iron')
        local_db = [db.get_atoms(id) for id in results]
